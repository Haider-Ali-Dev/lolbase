### lolbase
A firebase alternative written in Rust.

### Status
Currently in development

### Aims
- To provide fast and reliable backend for modern aplications
- Free and opensource, any donations are accepted
- Comes with very amazing features

After seeing a lot of firebase alternatives, I had the same feeling that every rustacean would have "it would be better if it been written in Rust" and yes Rust makes your software a lot better.

`lolbase` is focused to provide good developer experienced to developers and companies, the best thing about `lolbase` is that you can rewrite or customize any part of its codebase as it's open source. We are focused to add more features to ease developer work. In future you can see `lolbase-sdks` for programming languages like python, java, javascript, etc. 

These `lolbase-sdks` will only come out once the project is ready and can be used for applications.


### Why so small README?

There isn't much code or features in lolbase so the README will be small.

As the codebase expands, the README will expand.
